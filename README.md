ProgressWatchJawsh
==================
Took the liberty of updating Igorfv's progress bar watch so that it now works on the 2.0 firmware.

I just found this design particularly nice and it was one of the few things I really missed from before the update.

I did this just fiddling around, I have no knowledge of C so I hope it's all working right. Any bugs please comment.

It basically shows the progress of the Year, Month, Week and Day.
